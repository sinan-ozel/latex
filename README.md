![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/sinan-sozel/latex/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This is a simple template repo for creating LaTeX documents.

It has a VSCode .devcontainer, which means that if you have Docker and VS Code,
you do not need to install anything else.
Run in the devcontainer, and run the task Build LaTeX to create your PDF.
Alternatively, push to github, and your documenta will be created as an artifact
and committed to your repo.
(The devcontainer is based on the GitHub Actions steps container, so they both create the same results.)
